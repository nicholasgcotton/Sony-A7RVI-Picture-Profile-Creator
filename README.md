## How to install (system-wide)

### macOS

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p "/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CameraRaw/CameraProfiles/Camera/Sony ILCE-7RM6"

sudo cp "./output/Sony ILCE-7RM6"/*.dcp \
        "/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CameraRaw/CameraProfiles/Camera/Sony ILCE-7RM6/"

sudo chown root:wheel \
        "/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CameraRaw/CameraProfiles/Camera/Sony ILCE-7RM6"/*.dcp

sudo chmod 644 \
        "/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CameraRaw/CameraProfiles/Camera/Sony ILCE-7RM6"/*.dcp
```

Alternatively, copy them via Finder (requires Finder authentication).

### Windows

Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:

```powershell
$dest = "C:\ProgramData\Adobe\CameraRaw\CameraProfiles\Camera\Sony ILCE-7RM6"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dest
Copy-Item ".\output\Sony ILCE-7RM6\*.dcp" -Destination $dest
```

Or copy the files with File Explorer — navigate to
`C:\ProgramData\Adobe\CameraRaw\CameraProfiles\Camera\`, create a
`Sony ILCE-7RM6` folder, and paste the `.dcp` files in (administrator
confirmation required).

## How to import into Lightroom Classic

You can install via the **system folder** (above) or the **Lightroom import
dialog** — choose one.

**Import dialog method (no admin rights needed):**

1. Open Lightroom Classic with an **ILCE-7RM6** raw file selected.
2. Switch to the **Develop** module.
3. In the **Basic** panel, click the **Profile** box → **Browse…**
4. In the Profile Browser, click the hamburger menu **(☰)** → **Import Profiles…**
5. Navigate to the `output/Sony ILCE-7RM6/` folder inside this project.
6. Select all 11 `.dcp` files → **Review** → **Import**.
7. The profiles appear under **Camera Matching** as e.g. `Camera ST (A7RVI)`.

> **Note**: You must have an ILCE-7RM6 raw file open; Lightroom only shows
> profiles that match the `UniqueCameraModel` tag of the current image.

## Technical details

### What a DCP file is

A **DCP (DNG Camera Profile)** is a TIFF-family binary file. Its IFD
(Image File Directory) entries store colour transformation data as private
Adobe tags. The file is typically < 500 KB; the dominant payload is the
LookTable (a 3D colour LUT) and optional ToneCurve.

### Patch pipeline

The script reads the donor DCP as raw bytes, walks its IFD, and patches
values in-place where possible:

| Operation                                   | Strategy                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ASCII model strings                         | Append new string at end of file, update IFD offset + count   |
| SRATIONAL matrices (9 × 8 bytes = 72 bytes) | Overwrite existing slot — same size, no pointer change needed |
| Everything else                             | Untouched (byte-for-byte copy)                                |

### Colour matrix sources

| Tag              | Hex      | Source                              |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `ColorMatrix1`   | `0xC621` | `Sony ILCE-7RM6 Adobe Standard.dcp` |
| `ColorMatrix2`   | `0xC622` | `Sony ILCE-7RM6 Adobe Standard.dcp` |
| `ForwardMatrix1` | `0xC714` | ProPhoto RGB → XYZ D50 (see below)  |
| `ForwardMatrix2` | `0xC715` | ProPhoto RGB → XYZ D50 (see below)  |

**ColorMatrix** values extracted from the A7RVI's own Adobe Standard profile
(illuminant D65 for CM2, standard illuminant A for CM1). This gives the A7RVI
correct sensor characterisation for white-balance computation.

```
Color Matrix 1                  : 1.1263 -0.7003 0.149 -0.2636 0.9664 0.3487 0.0148 0.0267 0.6591
Color Matrix 2                  : 1.1765 -0.5595 -0.1192 -0.3689 1.1507 0.2485 0.0051 0.0681 0.5731
Calibration Illuminant 1        : Standard Light A
Calibration Illuminant 2        : D65
```

### ForwardMatrix: ProPhoto RGB → XYZ D50

```
ForwardMatrix1 = ForwardMatrix2 =
  [ 0.7976749,  0.1351917,  0.0313534,
    0.2880402,  0.7118741,  0.0000857,
    0.0000000,  0.0000000,  0.8252100 ]
```

This is the **canonical identity forward matrix** for Camera Matching profiles.
It is the exact ProPhoto RGB primaries expressed in XYZ D50, which tells
Lightroom "delegate all creative colour work to the LookTable — do not apply
any additional chromatic adaptation." This is the same matrix Adobe uses in
every other Camera Matching DCP.

### Why ColorMatrix and ForwardMatrix are not independent

The two represent the same transform via:

```
F × D = CAT(WP → D50) × C⁻¹
```

where:

- **C** = ColorMatrix (sensor raw → XYZ)
- **F** = ForwardMatrix (ProPhoto RGB → XYZ D50)
- **D** = diagonal white-balance multiplier matrix
- **CAT** = Bradford chromatic adaptation transform

When no ForwardMatrix is present, Lightroom inverts C and adapts chromatically.
In Camera Matching profiles, F is always the ProPhoto pass-through above, so
Lightroom uses C only for white balance and lets the LookTable handle the
creative colour rendition.

### LookTable and ToneCurve

These are taken **byte-for-byte** from the RX1R III donor profiles. The
LookTable encodes Sony's Picture Profile rendering (e.g. Vivid saturation boost,
Black & White desaturation). The ToneCurve encodes the S-curve contrast. Both
are sensor-response-independent and transfer cleanly to the A7RVI.

## Troubleshooting

**Profiles don't appear in Lightroom**

- Ensure the open image is an ILCE-7RM6 raw file (ARW).
- Restart Lightroom after installing to the system folder.
- Try the Import dialog method instead of the system folder.

**Lightroom crashes immediately after importing the profiles**

- This is a known first-launch quirk. When Lightroom encounters a new batch
  of DCP files for the first time it rebuilds its profile index, which can
  cause a crash on some systems.
- **Workaround**: Simply relaunch Lightroom. On the second launch the index
  is already built and the profiles load and work correctly. No further
  crashes should occur.

**"Permission denied" when running the script**

- The script writes to `./output/` (no elevated permissions needed). If you
  see permission errors, check that the `output/` subfolder is writable.
- For system-wide install, `sudo` (macOS) or **Run as Administrator** (Windows)
  is required only for the copy step, not for running the script itself.

**Profile looks wrong / colours are off**

- Verify the A7RVI Adobe Standard DCP is present at the path listed in the
  [Paths reference](#paths-reference) above.
- Re-run the script; it prints the ColorMatrix values it extracted so you can
  cross-check them.

**Windows: `C:\ProgramData` is not visible in File Explorer**

- Enable **Show hidden items** in File Explorer's View menu, or type the path
  directly into the address bar.

## FAQ

### Why do these profiles work, but the ones bundled in Lightroom look wrong for the A7RVI?

As of mid-2026, Adobe has not yet released official Camera Matching profiles
for the ILCE-7RM6. The profiles that Lightroom _does_ show for the A7RVI are a
fallback — either the generic **Adobe Color / Adobe Standard** profiles (which
are built from Adobe's own perceptual model and make no attempt to replicate
Sony's in-camera Picture Profiles), or profiles from a closely-related camera
that Lightroom maps as a proxy.

Here is why these generated profiles look better at matching in-camera JPEGs:

| What              | Bundled Adobe profiles              | These profiles                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **ColorMatrix**   | From the A7RVI sensor calibration ✓ | Also from the A7RVI sensor calibration ✓           |
| **ForwardMatrix** | Adobe's perceptual creative matrix  | ProPhoto RGB pass-through (neutral)                |
| **LookTable**     | Adobe Color look, or none           | Sony's own Picture Profile LUT (from the RX1R III) |
| **ToneCurve**     | Adobe's curve                       | Sony's S-curve (from the RX1R III)                 |

The critical element is the **LookTable**. Sony's Camera Matching Look Tables
encode the specific hue, saturation, and luminance shifts that reproduce each
Picture Profile (Standard, Vivid, Neutral, etc.) — the same rendering the
camera applies when generating in-camera JPEGs. Adobe's built-in profiles for
the A7RVI don't have these LUTs because Adobe has not yet characterised the
camera for them.

The RX1R III is a closely related Sony camera whose sensor pipeline produces
very similar colour science to the A7RVI. Its Picture Profile LUTs transfer
cleanly: the colour engine (ColorMatrix) is kept A7RVI-specific, while the
creative rendering (LookTable + ToneCurve) comes from the RX1R III. The
ForwardMatrix is set to the neutral ProPhoto pass-through so that Lightroom
applies no additional creative adaptation on top of the LUT.

The net result is that the rendered colour in Lightroom closely matches what
you see in-camera — which is precisely what Camera Matching profiles are
designed to do.
